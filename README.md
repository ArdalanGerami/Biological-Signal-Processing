Including projects
- Calculating the optimum order of the parametric model for a process using AR, MA, and ARMA models and their different sub-methods like Yule-Walker, Levinsion-Doublin, etc.
- Using parametric methods, like Prony, PHD, Capon, and non-parametric methods, like Welch, Blackman-Tuckey, and Periodogram, for spectral estimation.
- Removing the noise of an ECG signal using Adaptive Filters.
- Using Kalman filter to estimate state variables.
- Cepstrum analysis for ECG signal.
